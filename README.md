# Bootcamp Quiz - Module 4

Code quiz that counts down to 0 as qustions are answered.

## Description

- Code is currently only in a partially functioning state
- Start button functions but timer is not displayed to countdown  
  This homework was much tougher than the password. I need to practice either better variable naming practices or find ways to cutdown on the total amount of variables flying around as fidning what went where slowed me down terribly.
