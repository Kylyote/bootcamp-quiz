# Bootcamp Quiz - Module 4

Code quiz that counts down to 0 as questions are answered.

## Description

This is a simple website that can be used to create multiple choice quizzes. As of right now it is more focused towards coding of JavaScript and HTML. The question arrays can be easily expanded upon to include more topics. The answer and answer key arrays will have to be properly updated as well to reflect the additional questions.

Future development can see the implementation of written answers and possible integration into an open AI engine so that written responses will not have to match the correct answer word for word.
